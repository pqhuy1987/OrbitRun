Orbivoid

SpriteKit demo game used in http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WBxYzws7vA .

You control an orb with your finger; your goal is to not get hit by other orbs.

Demonstrates the following features:

* SKAction
* SKPhysicsBody including collision contact callbacks
* Nodes, sprites
* Particle effects

Since the video, I've been working on adding other features to make it into more of a real game.
